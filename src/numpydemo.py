# a = numpy.

#1. declare empty array.  we know size in advance.  cos starting from beginning of list and moving forward.  parameter:  maxDaysLookBack
# there will always be more historical games than days?  no. not if sparse games.  
# still works.  we know init day and current day and we know days between.  more importantly we know index which is height of future numpy array.  
# TODO - iterate through data/preparedWithNnArrays.json
